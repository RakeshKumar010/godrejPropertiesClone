          Life is all about simpler joys and living in Pune is about cherishing
          those simple joys. With pleasant weather, a rapidly growing IT sector,
          and opulent neighbourhoods, Pune is ranked as one of the most livable
          cities in India. The second-largest city in Maharashtra, Pune has
          people from all over India moving in to work and live. The easy
          availability of a varied range of housing options such as 2 BHK flats,
          apartments, duplex flats, etc. further makes Pune an ideal destination
          for working professionals and job seekers.
          <br /> <br /> 
          And with one after another state-of-the-art residential project,
          Godrej Properties makes Pune move-in ready. Godrej has its luxurious 2
